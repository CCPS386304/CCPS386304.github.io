    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>What am I working toward in my personal and professional life and what experiences led me here?In my personal and professional life, I am trying to work toward going to college. To find myself and learn about a maintainable and money-making job I could have in the future. Some experiences that led me here would be playing football. The minimum GPA to play football is a 2.0. But I want to work to get way higher than that.
How am I working toward these goals?I am working toward these goals of college by doing my best to maintain good grades. Maybe great grades. I kicked the year off with not very good grades but here in the third quarter of my freshman year I am shooting for straight A's. I currently have A's and two B's, so I'm getting there.
What values do I consider most necessary for my success?I of course value my grades to be the most necessary thing for my success. Also, hang out with the right crowd to make sure I don't get into any trouble in high school. And my mom is also one more thing for my success because she mostly knows what's best for me.
What short-term goals do I hope to accomplish in the near future?Short-term goals that I hope to accomplish in the near future would definitely be a major that I can be studying in college. I want one that I would be really interested in and entertaining, not just one that could make me money.
What are the character traits and achievements I most want to be known for?Some character traits and achievements I mostly want to be known for is being one of the hardest working students in the class that almost always gets the work done. Not perfectly but always on time.</p>
